# Simulink-DSP-Viewer
This is a basic Matlab Simulink Model and C template for practicing with DSP.

# How-to

Simply open the .slx file using Matlab Simulink and run everything from there.

The workflow goes as follows:

1- Add your DSP code into the C file;
2- Execute the Simulink simulation;
3- Analyse results on the simulation.

It's that simple.

Also, you can add your own blocks to the Simulink model, so you're not limited to the C program.
